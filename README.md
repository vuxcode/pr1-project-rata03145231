# Project Summary

Project Presentation
The project is a simple browser game based on Rock, Paper, Scissors. The player plays against the computer, and the game keeps track of the score. HTML and CSS are used for structure and design, and JavaScript is used to make the game work.
Reflection
The biggest problem I had was understanding JavaScript. Compared to HTML and CSS, JavaScript was much harder to understand. With HTML and CSS, it felt easier to see what I was doing and create something from nothing. Because JavaScript felt more difficult, I chose to make a simpler project.
The biggest struggle in the code was the reset button. I had trouble understanding how to reset the game and the scores. I eventually solved it in a way similar to a YouTube video I had seen, but it took time to understand how it worked.
A smaller struggle was handling the score for the player and the computer. Once I realized I could use an if statement for a draw, an else if for player wins, and an else for losses, the logic became much clearer.
Improvements
If I had more time, I would:
Improve my JavaScript structure


Make the game logic cleaner


Improve the design and user experience


Add more features to the game


Time Budget Conclusion
I did not fully stick to the time budget. I was about 7 hours short because of other school projects and tests. If I could do it again, I would not take the web programming course at the same time as the programming course, since it made time management harder.
